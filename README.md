## 💡 How It Works

1. Add a transaction using the form (positive for income, negative for expense).  
2. The app calculates the new total balance, income, and expense instantly.  
3. Transactions are saved locally so they persist even after refresh.  
4. Click the **"x"** button to delete any transaction.
